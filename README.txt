This is a prototype (or a concept) of an lottery game raffle.
The initial idea is to be useful in any project you want, where you just Require the archive and then construct your variable,
like the example below:

	lottery_game = LotteryGame.new

And then you call it in your algorithmn

	lottery_game.game_init(String_Param)

game_init(String_arg) is a function defined to receive a name of any user that will interact with the game, the same user that is using 
your project in question.

You can also call it without passing parameters
Like that:
	
	lottery_game.game_init

game_init this function is defined without using any user name in your project, it runs without mentioning any user playing the game.


This a simple briefing of the prototype. I will still working on it and maybe someday becomes something big(or almost).


Feel free to use and improve.
